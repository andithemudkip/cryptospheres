## Version 1
I wrote version 1 a pretty long time ago, it was intitially intended to be a social media bot that posted a new planet hourly.
You can find the code for the first one [this repo](https://github.com/andithemudkip/planet-gen).

You can find examples of what it generates in the aforementioned repo.
## Version 2
Version 2 includes some special sauce that makes the planets look **a lot** more artistic and just overall nice imo.

### A couple examples:
